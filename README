A library for determining the reachability of a certain host, it does however not check if that host is actually up. Just if you in theory could reach it.

Requires:
* Mac OS X 10.5 or later

How to use (example in Ruby):

framework 'ceres-reachability'

class CSReachabilityDelegate
  def onConnect; puts "Connected! :)"; end
  def onDisconnect; puts "Disconnected! :("; end
end

CSReachability.reachabilityWithHost("api.eve-online.com", delegate: CSReachabilityDelegate.new)
NSApplication.sharedApplication.run
